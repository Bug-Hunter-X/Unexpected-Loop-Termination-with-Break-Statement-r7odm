This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving the unintended use of `break` statements within loops.  The `bug.js` file contains code that prematurely exits a loop, showcasing a potential pitfall in JavaScript programming.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code, addressing the unexpected loop termination and ensuring the loop runs as intended.

This example highlights the importance of careful consideration when using control flow statements such as `break` and `continue` in JavaScript loops.
